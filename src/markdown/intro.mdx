# What we're looking for
This is a (relatively) straightforward exercise to test your frontend development skills. In particular, we're assessing your ability to:

1. Pull down a GitHub repo and work with it locally. Congrats! You've already checked off 20% of this list. You're crushing it!
1. Get data from a remote source.
1. Structure a component (ideally, using the principles of atomic design).
1. Pass props into a React component.
1. Style the component using Tailwind CSS.

# Rules

## Documentation
Developers and documentation go together like apple pie and vanilla ice cream. You wouldn't have one without the other, would you? *Would you?!* (no, seriously, you need to answer this. it's part of the test. I'm checking to make sure you're reading the instructions. attention to detail is kind of important.)

Feel free to use any online or offline references you'd like -- we've even included a few helpful links in the challenge instructions.

## Use of AI
AI is an amazing tool. But so are you! And we want to see what kind of a tool you are. (yep. we made that terrible joke. and you laughed. don't lie.)

**You CAN:** Use AI autocomplete functionality in your IDE if you have it available. If you choose to do so we'll be closely evaluating *how* you use it, whether you understand the code it's writing, and if you let any AI-generated mistakes slip through. Spoiler alert: Don't let any AI-generated mistakes slip through.

**You CAN NOT:** Use AI to do the challenge for you. We want to see your skills, creativity, and problem-solving ability. So no prompt engineering (including slash commands (eg `/fix`) or chat functionality in your IDE). No AI agents. No image-to-code tools.

## Careful with the copy-paste
Copy-pasting big chunks of code will be looked upon with a hyper-critical eye. If you're copying code into the IDE, you'll need to show where it's coming from. Again, online documentation is fine -- we just need to see the browser window you're copying from.

# Rubber ducking is encouraged
Feel free to talk through your thought process, crack jokes, or even sing (if that's what you're into). We want this to be a collaborative experience, so please ask for help if you get stuck or have any questions.

# About the project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). You're not being explicitly tested on your Next.js knowledge, so let us know if you have any questions about the setup.
